"""
This module provides tools and algorithms for manipulating and analyzing graphs,
particularly focused on partitioning graphs based on population data. It leverages the
NetworkX library to handle graph structures and implements various algorithms for graph
partitioning and tree traversal.

Key functionalities include:

- Predecessor and successor functions for graph traversal using breadth-first search.
- Implementation of random and uniform spanning trees for graph partitioning.
- The `PopulatedGraph` class, which represents a graph with additional population data,
  and methods for assessing and modifying this data.
- Functions for finding balanced edge cuts in a populated graph, either through
  contraction or memoization techniques.
- A suite of functions (`bipartition_tree`, `recursive_tree_part`, `get_seed_chunks`, etc.)
  for partitioning graphs into balanced subsets based on population targets and tolerances.
- Utility functions like `get_max_prime_factor_less_than` and `recursive_seed_part_inner`
  to assist in complex partitioning tasks.

Dependencies:

- networkx: Used for graph data structure and algorithms.
- random: Provides random number generation for probabilistic approaches.
- typing: Used for type hints.

    Returns a partition with ``num_dists`` districts balanced within ``epsilon`` of
    ``pop_target`` by recursively splitting graph using recursive_seed_part_inner.

    :param graph: The graph
    :type graph: nx.Graph
    :param parts: Iterable of part labels (like ``[0,1,2]`` or ``range(4)``
    :type parts: Sequence

        of the partition can be
    :type epsilon: float
    :param method: Function used to find balanced partitions at the 2-district level
        Defaults to :func:`~gerrychain.tree_methods.bipartition_tree`
    :type method: Callable, optional
    :param node_repeats: Parameter for :func:`~gerrychain.tree_methods.bipartition_tree` to use.
        Defaults to 1.
    :type node_repeats: int, optional
    :param n: Either a positive integer (greater than 1) or None. If n is a positive integer,
        this function will recursively create a seed plan by either biting off districts from graph
        or dividing graph into n chunks and recursing into each of these. If n is None, this
        function prime factors ``num_dists``=n_1*n_2*...*n_k (n_1 > n_2 > ... n_k) and recursively
        partitions graph into n_1 chunks. Defaults to None.
    :type n: Optional[int], optional
    :param ceil: Either a positive integer (at least 2) or None. Relevant only if n is None. If
        ``ceil`` is a positive integer then finds the largest factor of ``num_dists`` less than or
        equal to ``ceil``, and recursively splits graph into that number of chunks, or bites off a
        district if that number is 1. Defaults to None.
